PROBLEM STATEMENT

“We focus on protecting smartphone user’s GPS location around user preconfigured sensitive locations”.

OUR IDEA

* We propose to mock the original location to all the android applications when user feels he is around a sensitive location.
* Whenever user enters a location space with a pre-configured radius around sensitive location, we try to mock locations by tracing along the circumference of that sensitive space
* Since user smartphone is always connected to the internet and we can’t expect him to be read every notification about his location mocking, we notified the GPS mocking activity to one’s smart watch.
